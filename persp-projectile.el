;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library bridges perspective mode to the awesome library
;; Projectile.  The idea is to create a separate perspective when
;; switching project.  A perspective is an independant workspace for
;; Emacs, similar to multiple desktops in Gnome and MacOS.  I often
;; work on many projects at the same time, and using perspective and
;; projectile together allows me to easily know which project I'm
;; current in, and focus on files that only belong to current project
;; when switching buffer.

;; To use this library, put this file in your Emacs load path, and
;; call (require 'persp-projectile)

;; See perspective.el on github: https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el

;;; Code:
(require 'perspective)
(require 'projectile)

;; TODO this may be incompatible helm which let's you find stuff in new frame
