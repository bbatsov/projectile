  `projectile-file-exists-remote-cache-expire` and
  `projectile-file-exists-local-cache-expire`.

* Added new command `projectile-save-project-buffers`.
* Added new command `projectile-cleanup-known-projects`.
* Added new commands `projectile-display-buffer`
  and`projectile-find-dir-other-window`.

  which runs new `projectile-project-buffers-non-visible` function, the former
  is bound to `C-c p ESC`.
* New variable `projectile-enable-idle-timer` turns on an idle timer
  which runs the hook `projectile-idle-timer-hook` every
  `projectile-idle-timer-seconds` seconds when non-nil.
* New defcustom `projectile-remember-window-configs` will make
  `projectile-switch-project` restore the most recent window configuration (if
  any) of the target project.

* New command `projectile-run-shell-command-in-root`.
* New command `projectile-run-async-shell-command-in-root`.
* New defcustom `projectile-use-git-grep` will make `projectile-grep` use `git grep`
for git projects.
* Added new `projectile-commander` methods ?v and ?R which run
  `projectile-vc` and `projectile-regenerate-tags`, respectively.
* `projectile-vc` will use `magit-status` if available.
* New functions `projectile-find-implementation-or-test` and
  `projectile-find-implementation-or-test-other-window`, the later is
  bound to `C-c p 4 t`.
* New defcustoms `projectile-test-prefix-function` and `projectile-test-suffix-function`
allow users to customize how projectile identifies test files by project type.
* `projectile-grep` will ask for a file pattern if invoked with a
  prefix argument.

* New function `projectile-process-current-project-buffers`.

* Projectile is now able to find the project pertaining to a symlink
pointing to a version-controlled file.
* Drop `projectile-ack-function` defcustom.
* `projectile-command-map` is now the keymap referenced by the
  `projectile-keymap-prefix` in `projectile-mode-map`. This allows
  modification of the inner map, and allows additional prefix keys to
  reference it.

  instead of overriding them.
