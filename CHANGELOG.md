## 0.11.0 (05/27/2014)

### New features

* Added support for default file glob pattern to `projectile-grep`
* added file existence cache with defcustoms
  `projectile-file-exists-remote-cache-expire` and
  `projectile-file-exists-local-cache-expire`.
* added new defcustoms `projectile-project-root-files-top-down-recurring`,
  `projectile-project-root-files-bottom-up` and
  `projectile-project-root-files-functions`.
* Added new command `projectile-save-project-buffers`.
* Added new command `projectile-cleanup-known-projects`.
* Added new commands `projectile-display-buffer`
  and`projectile-find-dir-other-window`.
* Added new interacive function `projectile-project-buffers-other-buffer`
  which runs new `projectile-project-buffers-non-visible` function, the former
  is bound to `C-c p ESC`.
* New variable `projectile-enable-idle-timer` turns on an idle timer
  which runs the hook `projectile-idle-timer-hook` every
  `projectile-idle-timer-seconds` seconds when non-nil.
* New defcustom `projectile-remember-window-configs` will make
  `projectile-switch-project` restore the most recent window configuration (if
  any) of the target project.
* New command `projectile-run-command-in-root`.
* New command `projectile-run-shell-command-in-root`.
* New command `projectile-run-async-shell-command-in-root`.
* New defcustom `projectile-use-git-grep` will make `projectile-grep` use `git grep`
for git projects.
* Added new `projectile-commander` methods ?v and ?R which run
  `projectile-vc` and `projectile-regenerate-tags`, respectively.
* `projectile-vc` will use `magit-status` if available.
* New functions `projectile-find-implementation-or-test` and
  `projectile-find-implementation-or-test-other-window`, the later is
  bound to `C-c p 4 t`.
* New defcustoms `projectile-test-prefix-function` and `projectile-test-suffix-function`
allow users to customize how projectile identifies test files by project type.
* `projectile-grep` will ask for a file pattern if invoked with a
  prefix argument.
* Subversion checkouts are now automatically detected.
* CVS checkouts are now automatically detected.
* added `projectile-persp-switch-project` command to make perspective
  mode work along with projectile.
* Changed `projectile-mode-line-lighter` to a defcustom variable to make
mode line indicator prefix customizable.
* New command `projectile-find-file-in-known-projects`.
* New defcustom `projectile-ignored-projects` allows you to specify projects
that shouldn't be added to the known projects list.
* New command `projectile-remove-current-project-from-known-projects`.
* New defcustom `projectile-buffers-filter-function`.
* New defcustom `projectile-sort-order`.
* New function `projectile-process-current-project-buffers`.
* New function `projectile-process-current-project-files`.

### Changes

* The presence of a `Makefile` is no longer taken as an indicator
  of the project root by default, since recursive make is unfortunately
  a common occurrence (affects `projectile-project-root-files`).
* Projectile is now able to find the project pertaining to a symlink
pointing to a version-controlled file.
* Drop `projectile-ack-function` defcustom.
* `projectile-command-map` is now the keymap referenced by the
  `projectile-keymap-prefix` in `projectile-mode-map`. This allows
  modification of the inner map, and allows additional prefix keys to
  reference it.

### Bugs fixed

* Modified `projectile-ack` to append to `ack-and-a-half-arguments`
  instead of overriding them.
* [#229] Fix `projectile-find-file-in-directory`'s behavior for project directories

understandable error if current buffer is not visiting a file.
* [#244] Correct folder picked up by `projectile-ack` after project-switch.
* [#182] Invalidate project cache if .projectile is modified.

### New features

* Added new command `projectile-find-file-other-window`.

  run many Projectile commands with a single key. Very useful as a
  project-switching action.

the switch action is `projectile-commander`.

### Changes

  present you'll be prompted for the project whose cache to
  invalidate.

* Reworked `projectile-compile-project` and `projectile-test-project`
  to be smarter, more configurable and closer in behavior to the stock
  `compile` command
* `projectile-switch-project` (<kbd>C-c p s</kbd>) now runs `projectile-find-file` instead of `dired`.
