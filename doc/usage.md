## Usage

### Basic setup

To add a project to Projectile, open a file in the project and enable `projectile-mode` in that buffer. If you have a projects directory, you can tell Projectile about all of the projects in it with the command `M-x projectile-discover-projects-in-directory`.

To make Projectile automatically remember projects that you access files in, enable Projectile mode:

```el
(projectile-mode)
```

If you're going to use the default `ido` completion it's
**extremely highly** recommended that you install the optional
[flx-ido package](https://github.com/lewang/flx), which provides a much
more powerful alternative to `ido`'s built-in `flex` matching.

<kbd>C-c p ESC</kbd> | Switch to the most recently selected Projectile buffer.

If you ever forget any of Projectile's keybindings just do a:

<kbd>C-c p C-h</kbd>

You can change the default keymap prefix `C-c p` like this:

```el
(setq projectile-keymap-prefix (kbd "C-c C-p"))
```

It is also possible to add additional commands to
`projectile-command-map` referenced by the prefix key in
`projectile-mode-map`. You can even add an alternative prefix for all
commands. Here's an example that adds `super-p` as the extra prefix:

```el
(define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "s-p") 'projectile-command-map)
```

You can also bind the `projectile-command-map` to any other map you'd
like (including the global keymap).  Prelude does this for its
[prelude-mode-map](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/blob/master/core/prelude-mode.el#L71).

For some common commands you might want to take a little shortcut and
leverage the fairly unused `Super` key (by default `Command` on Mac
keyboards and `Windows` on Win keyboards). Here's something you can
add to your Emacs config:

```el
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-d] 'projectile-find-dir)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-p] 'projectile-switch-project)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-f] 'projectile-find-file)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-g] 'projectile-grep)
```

Note that the `Super` keybindings are not usable in Windows. Emacs
Prelude already adds those extra keybindings.

### Ignoring files

If you'd like to instruct Projectile to ignore certain files in a
project, when indexing it you can do so in the `.projectile` file by
adding each path to ignore, where the paths all are relative to the
root directory and start with a slash. Everything ignored should be
preceded with a `-` sign. Alternatively, not having any prefix at all
also means to ignore the directory or file pattern that follows.
Here's an example for a typical Rails application:

```
-/log
-/tmp
-/vendor
-/public/uploads
```

This would ignore the folders only at the root of the project.
Projectile also supports relative pathname ignores:

```
-tmp
-*.rb
-*.yml
-models
```

You can also ignore everything except certain subdirectories. This is
useful when selecting the directories to keep is easier than selecting
the directories to ignore, although you can do both. To select
directories to keep, that means everything else will be ignored.

Example:

```
+/src/foo
+/tests/foo
```

Keep in mind that you can only include subdirectories, not file
patterns.

If both directories to keep and ignore are specified, the directories
to keep first apply, restricting what files are considered. The paths
and patterns to ignore are then applied to that set.

Finally, you can override ignored files. This is especially useful
when some files ignored by your VCS should be considered as part of
your project by projectile:

```
!/src/foo
!*.yml
```

When a path is overridden, its contents are still subject to ignore
patterns. To override those files as well, specify their full path
with a bang prefix.
