= Usage

NOTE: Everything in this section assumes you've enabled `projectile-mode`.

== Basic setup

In this section we'll cover the bare minimum of setup you might want to
do. Projectile works fine with no setup, but if you tweak the configuration a
bit you'll get more out of it.

Check out the xref:configuration.adoc["Configuration"] section of the manual
for a lot more information about configuring Projectile.

=== Automated Project Discovery

To add a project to Projectile's list of known projects, open a file
in the project. If you have a projects directory, you can tell
Projectile about all of the projects in it with the command `M-x
projectile-discover-projects-in-directory`.

You can go one step further and set a list of folders which Projectile
is automatically going to check for projects on startup.

Recursive discovery is configured by specifying the search depth in a cons cell:

[source,elisp]
----
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/projects/" "~/work/" ("~/github" . 1)))
----


You can suppress the auto-discovery of projects on startup by setting
`projectile-auto-discover` to `nil`. You can manually trigger the project
discovery using `M-x projectile-discover-projects-in-search-path`.

=== Minibuffer Completion

While Projectile works fine with Emacs's default minibuffer completion system you're highly encouraged to use some
powerful alternative like `ido`, `ivy` or `selectrum`.

TIP: If you're going to use the `ido` completion it's **highly** recommended that you install the optional
https://github.com/lewang/flx[flx-ido package], which provides a much more powerful
alternative to ``ido``'s built-in `flex` matching. Similarly, for `selectrum` it's
a good idea to enable `prescient` (a package similar to `flx`).

=== Installing External Tools

NOTE: Windows users can ignore this section unless they are using Emacs via WSL or `cygwin`.

It's recommended to install the following command-line tools:

* `fd` (a super-fast alternative to `find`)
* `ag` (a.k.a. `the_silver_searcher`, a powerful alternative to `grep`) or `rg` (a.k.a. `ripgrep`)

Projectile will make use of them automatically when available, and fallback to the standard Unix tools otherwise.

== Basic Usage

Just open some file in a version-controlled (e.g. `git`) or a project
(e.g. `maven`) directory that's recognized by Projectile and you're
ready for action. Projectile happens to recognize out of the box every common
VCS and many popular project types for various programming languages.
You can learn more about Projectile's notion of a project xref:projects.adoc[here].

NOTE: The extent of the support for every VCS differs and Git is the best supported
 one. Projectile supports some advanced features like working with Git submodules
 and using `git-grep` instead GNU grep.

You need to know only a handful of Projectile commands to start benefiting from it.

* Find file in current project (kbd:[s-p f])
* Switch project (kbd:[s-p p]) (you can also switch between open projects with kbd:[s-p q])
* Grep (search for text/regexp) in project (kbd:[s-p s g]) (`grep` alternatives like `ag`, `pt` and `rg` are also supported)
* Replace in project (kbd:[s-p r])
* Invoke any Projectile command via the Projectile Commander (kbd:[s-p m])
* Toggle between implementation and test (kbd:[s-p t])
* Toggle between related files (e.g. `foo.h` <-> `foo.c` and `Gemfile` <-> `Gemfile.lock`) (kbd:[s-p a])
* Run a shell command in the root of the project (kbd:[s-p !] for a sync command and kbd:[s-p &] for an async command)
* Run various pre-defined project commands like:
** build/compile project (kbd:[s-p c])
** test project (kbd:[s-p T])

The next section lists many more commands, but the basics can get you pretty far.

== Interactive Commands

NOTE: Projectile doesn't have a default key prefix for its commands, but all the examples
 in the manual assume you've opted for kbd:[s-p] (`super`-p).

If you ever forget any of Projectile's keybindings just do a:

kbd:[s-p C-h]

== Customizing Projectile's Keybindings

It is possible to add additional commands to
`projectile-command-map` referenced by the prefix key in
`projectile-mode-map`. You can add multiple keymap prefix for all
commands. Here's an example that adds `super-,` as a command prefix:

[source,elisp]
----
(define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "s-,") 'projectile-command-map)
----

You can also bind the `projectile-command-map` to any other map you'd
like (including the global keymap).

TIP: For some common commands you might want to take a little shortcut and
leverage the fairly unused `Super` key (by default `Command` on Mac
keyboards and `Windows` on Win keyboards).

Here's something you can
add to your Emacs config:

[source,elisp]
----
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-d] 'projectile-find-dir)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-p] 'projectile-switch-project)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-f] 'projectile-find-file)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-g] 'projectile-grep)
----

NOTE: Note that the `Super` keybindings are not usable in Windows, as Windows
 makes heavy use of such keybindings itself. Emacs Prelude already adds those
 extra keybindings.

== Projectile Commander

Projectile's Commander (`projectile-commander`) is a nifty utility for those of you who are struggling to remember a lot of keybindings. It provides a simple
interface to most of Projectile's commands via 1-character shortcuts that you
need to press after invoking the commander (e.g. via kbd:[s-p m]).

The commander was created with the idea to provide a powerful project switching command (it will be triggered if you press kbd:[C-u s-p p]), but it's very useful on its own as well.

|===
| Keybinding | Description
| kbd:[?]
| Commander help buffer.

| kbd:[D]
| Open project root in dired.

| kbd:[R]
| Regenerate the project's etags/gtags.

| kbd:[T]
| Find test file in project.

| kbd:[V]
| Browse dirty projects

| kbd:[a]
| Run ag on project.

| kbd:[b]
| Switch to project buffer.

| kbd:[d]
| Find directory in project.

| kbd:[e]
| Find recently visited file in project.

| kbd:[f]
| Find file in project.

| kbd:[g]
| Run grep on project.

| kbd:[j]
| Find tag in project.

| kbd:[k]
| Kill all project buffers.

| kbd:[o]
| Run multi-occur on project buffers.

| kbd:[r]
| Replace a string in the project.

| kbd:[s]
| Switch project.

| kbd:[v]
| Open project root in vc-dir or magit.
|===

You can add additional commands to the commander like this:

[source,elisp]
----
(def-projectile-commander-method ?f
  "Find file in project."
  (projectile-find-file))
----

Place such snippets after ``projectile-mode``'s init code.
