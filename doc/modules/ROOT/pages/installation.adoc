= Installation

NOTE: Projectile officially supports Emacs 25.1+.

The recommended way to install Projectile is via `package.el`.

== Prerequisites

You'll need to have Emacs installed (preferably the latest stable
release). If you're new to Emacs you might want to go through
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/index.html[the guided tour of Emacs]
and the built-in tutorial (just press kbd:[C-h t]).

== Installation via package.el

Projectile is available on the two major `package.el` community
maintained repos -
http://stable.melpa.org[MELPA Stable]
and http://melpa.org[MELPA].

You can install Projectile with the following command:

kbd:[M-x] `package-install` kbd:[RET] `projectile` kbd:[RET]

or by adding this bit of Emacs Lisp code to your Emacs initialization file
(`.emacs` or `init.el`):

[source,elisp]
----
(unless (package-installed-p 'projectile)
  (package-install 'projectile))
----

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

kbd:[M-x] `package-refresh-contents` kbd:[RET]

Keep in mind that MELPA packages are built automatically from
the `master` branch, meaning bugs might creep in there from time to
time. Never-the-less, installing from MELPA is a reasonable way of
obtaining Projectile, as the `master` branch is normally quite stable
and serious regressions there are usually fixed pretty quickly.

TIP: If you don't want to (or can't) wait for MELPA to rebuild Projectile,
 you can easily build and install an up-to-date MELPA package locally yourself. Check out
 http://emacsredux.com/blog/2015/05/10/building-melpa-packages-locally/[this article]
 for details on the subject.

Generally, users of the non-adventurous kind are advised to stick
with the stable releases, available from MELPA Stable.
You can pin Projectile to always use MELPA
Stable by adding this to your Emacs initialization:

[source,elisp]
----
(add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages '(projectile . "melpa-stable") t)
----

Finally add this to your Emacs config:

[source,elisp]
----
(require 'projectile)
(define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "s-p") 'projectile-command-map)
(define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "C-c p") 'projectile-command-map)
(projectile-mode +1)
----

NOTE: Those keymap prefixes are just a suggestion. Feel free to put
 there whatever works best for you.
 `C-c p` used to be the default prefix up to version 2.0, but
 starting with version 2.0 you have to select prefix key(s)
 yourself.

== Installation via use-package

`use-package` can be used to install Projectile via the ``package.el``'s repositories
http://stable.melpa.org[MELPA Stable] and http://melpa.org[MELPA].

If you wanted to install the version of Projectile which is what is to be found in
the `master` branch, declare the following in your Emacs initialization file
(`.emacs` or `init.el`):

[source,elisp]
----
(use-package projectile
  :ensure t
  :init
  (projectile-mode +1)
  :bind (:map projectile-mode-map
              ("s-p" . projectile-command-map)
              ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)))
----

However, if you wanted to be a bit more conservative and only use the stable
releases of Projectile, you'd declare the following:

[source,elisp]
----
(use-package projectile
  :ensure t
  :pin melpa-stable
  :init
  (projectile-mode +1)
  :bind (:map projectile-mode-map
              ("s-p" . projectile-command-map)
              ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)))
----

After placing one of the above s-expressions, evaluate it, for it to take effect
by entering: kbd:[C-x C-e].

For further configuration options with `use-package`, consult the
official https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package[use-package repository].

== Installation via el-get

Projectile is also available for installation from
the https://github.com/dimitri/el-get[el-get] package manager.

Provided you've already installed `el-get` you can install Projectile with the
following command:

kbd:[M-x] `el-get-install` kbd:[RET] `projectile` kbd:[RET]

== Installation on Debian and Ubuntu

Users of Debian 9 or later or Ubuntu 16.10 or later may simply
`apt-get install elpa-projectile`.

Your favourite Linux distribution might be providing a Projectile package as well.

== Emacs Prelude

Projectile is bundled with
https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude[Emacs Prelude]. If you're a Prelude
user, Projectile is already properly configured and ready for
action.
