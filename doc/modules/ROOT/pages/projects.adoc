== Supported Project Types

One of the main goals of Projectile is to operate on a wide range of project types
without the need for any configuration. To achieve this it contains a lot of
project detection logic and project type specific logic.

Broadly speaking, Projectile identifies projects like this:

* Directories that contain the special `.projectile` file
* Directories under version control (e.g. a Git repo)
* Directories that contain some project description file (e.g. a `Gemfile` for Ruby projects or `pom.xml` for Java maven-based projects)

While Projectile aims to recognize most project types out-of-the-box, it's also extremely
flexible configuration-wise, and you can easily alter the project detection logic.

TIP: If you'd like to override the default project detection functions you should
check out `projectile-project-root-functions`. We'll discuss how to tweak in more
details later in the documentation.

=== Version Control Systems

Projectile considers most version-controlled repos to be
a project. Out of the box Projectile supports:

* Git
* Mercurial
* Bazaar
* Subversion
* CVS
* Fossil
* Darcs

=== File markers

Projectile considers many files to denote the root of a project. Usually those files
are the configuration files of various build tools. Out of the box the following are supported:

|===
| File | Project Type

| rebar.config
| Rebar project file

| project.clj
| Leiningen project file

| build.boot
| Boot-clj project file

| deps.edn
| Clojure CLI project file

| SConstruct
| Scons project file

| default.nix
| Nix project file

| flake.nix
| Nix flake project file

| pom.xml
| Maven project file

| build.sbt
| SBT project file

| build.sc
| Mill project file

| gradlew
| Gradle wrapper script

| build.gradle
| Gradle project file

| .ensime
| Ensime configuration file

| Gemfile
| Bundler file

| requirements.txt
| Pip file

| setup.py
| Setuptools file

| tox.ini
| Tox file

| composer.json
| Composer project file

| Cargo.toml
| Cargo project file

| mix.exs
| Elixir mix project file

| stack.yaml
| Haskell's stack tool based project

| dune-project
| OCaml Dune project file

| info.rkt
| Racket package description file

| DESCRIPTION
| R package description file

| TAGS
| etags/ctags are usually in the root of project

| GTAGS
| GNU Global tags

| configure.in
| autoconf old style

| configure.ac
| autoconf new style

| cscope.out
| cscope

| Makefile
| Make

| CMakeLists.txt
| CMake

| WORKSPACE
| Bazel workspace file

| debian/control
| Debian package dpkg control file
|===

There's also Projectile's own `.projectile` which serves both as a project marker
and a configuration file. We'll talk more about later in this section.

== Adding Custom Project Types

If a project you are working on is recognized incorrectly or you want
to add your own type of projects you can add following to your Emacs
initialization code

[source,elisp]
----
(projectile-register-project-type 'npm '("package.json")
                                  :project-file "package.json"
				  :compile "npm install"
				  :test "npm test"
				  :run "npm start"
				  :test-suffix ".spec")
----

What this does is:

. add your own type of project, in this case `npm` package.
. add a list of files and/or folders in a root of the project that helps to identify the type, in this case it is only `package.json`.
. add _project-file_, which is typically the primary project configuration file. In this case that's `package.json`.
. add _compile-command_, in this case it is `npm install`.
. add _test-command_, in this case it is `npm test`.
. add _run-command_, in this case it is `npm start`.
. add test files suffix for toggling between implementation/test files, in this case it is `.spec`, so the implementation/test file pair could be `service.js`/`service.spec.js` for example.

Let's see a couple of more complex examples.

[source,elisp]
----
;; Ruby + RSpec
(projectile-register-project-type 'ruby-rspec '("Gemfile" "lib" "spec")
                                  :project-file "Gemfile"
                                  :compile "bundle exec rake"
                                  :src-dir "lib/"
                                  :test "bundle exec rspec"
                                  :test-dir "spec/"
                                  :test-suffix "_spec")

;; Ruby + Minitest
(projectile-register-project-type 'ruby-test '("Gemfile" "lib" "test")
                                  :project-file "Gemfile"
                                  :compile "bundle exec rake"
                                  :src-dir "lib/"
                                  :test "bundle exec rake test"
                                  :test-suffix "_test")

;; Rails + Minitest
(projectile-register-project-type 'rails-test '("Gemfile" "app" "lib" "db" "config" "test")
                                  :project-file "Gemfile"
                                  :compile "bundle exec rails server"
                                  :src-dir "lib/"
                                  :test "bundle exec rake test"
                                  :test-suffix "_test")

;; Rails + RSpec
(projectile-register-project-type 'rails-rspec '("Gemfile" "app" "lib" "db" "config" "spec")
                                  :project-file "Gemfile"
                                  :compile "bundle exec rails server"
                                  :src-dir "lib/"
                                  :test "bundle exec rspec"
                                  :test-dir "spec/"
                                  :test-suffix "_spec")
----

All those projects are using `Gemfile` (``bundler``'s project file), but they have different directory structures.

Below is a listing of all the available options for `projectile-register-project-type`:

|===
| Option | Documentation

| :project-file
| A file, relative to the project root, typically the main project file (e.g. `pom.xml` for Maven projects).

| :compilation-dir
| A path, relative to the project root, from where to run the tests and compilation commands.

| :compile
| A command to compile the project.

| :configure
| A command to configure the project. `%s` will be substituted with the project root.

| :install
| A function to install the project.

| :package
| A function to package the project.

| :run
| A command to run the project.

| :src-dir
| A path, relative to the project root, where the source code lives.  A function may also be specified which takes one parameter - the directory of a test file, and it should return the directory in which the implementation file should reside.  This option is only used for implementation/test toggling.

| :test
| A command to test the project.

| :test-dir
| A path, relative to the project root, where the test code lives.  A function may also be specified which takes one parameter - the directory of a file, and it should return the directory in which the test file should reside.  This option is only used for implementation/test toggling.

| :test-prefix
| A prefix to generate test files names.

| :test-suffix
| A suffix to generate test files names.

| :related-files-fn
| A function to specify test/impl/other files in a more flexible way.
|===

==== Returning Projectile Commands from a function

You can also pass a symbolic reference to a function into your project type definition if you wish to define the compile command dynamically:

[source,elisp]
----
(defun my/compile-command ()
  "Returns a String representing the compile command to run for the given context"
  (cond
   ((and (eq major-mode 'java-mode)
         (not (string-match-p (regexp-quote "\\.*/test/\\.*") (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)))))
    "./gradlew build")
   ((eq major-mode 'web-mode)
    "./gradlew compile-templates")
   ))

(defun my/test-command ()
  "Returns a String representing the test command to run for the given context"
  (cond
   ((eq major-mode 'js-mode) "grunt test") ;; Test the JS of the project
   ((eq major-mode 'java-mode) "./gradlew test") ;; Test the Java code of the project
   ((eq major-mode 'my-mode) "special-command.sh") ;; Even Special conditions/test-sets can be covered
   ))

(projectile-register-project-type 'has-command-at-point '("file.txt")
                                  :compile 'my/compile-command
                                  :test 'my/test-command)
----

If you would now navigate to a file that has the `*.java` extension under the `./tests/` directory and hit `C-c c p` you
will see `./gradlew build` as the suggestion. If you were to navigate to a HTML file the compile command will have switched
to `./gradlew compile-templates`.

This works for:

* `:configure`
* `:compile`
* `:compilation-dir`
* `:run`

Note that your function has to return a string to work properly.

=== Related file location

The `:test-prefix` and `:test-suffix` will work regardless of file extension
or directory path should and be enough for simple projects.  The
`projectile-other-file-alist` variable can also be set to find other files
based on the extension.

For fine-grained control of implementation/test toggling, the `:test-dir` option
of a project may take a function of one parameter (the implementation
directory absolute path) and return the directory of the test file. This in
conjunction with the options `:test-prefix` and `:test-suffix` will then be
used to determine the full path of the test file. This option will always be
respected if it is set.

Similarly, the `:src-dir` option, the analogue of `:test-dir`, may also take a
function and exhibits exactly the same behaviour as above except that its
parameter corresponds to the directory of a test file and it should return the
directory of the corresponding implementation file.

It's recommended that either both or neither of these options are set to
functions for consistent behaviour.

Alternatively, for flexible file switching across a range of projects,
the `:related-files-fn` option set to a custom function or a
list of custom functions can be used. The custom function accepts the relative
file name from the project root and it should return related file information
as a plist with the following optional key/value pairs:

|===
| Key | Value | Command applicable

| :impl
| matching implementation file if the given file is a test file
| projectile-toggle-between-implementation-and-test, projectile-find-related-file

| :test
| matching test file if the given file has test files.
| projectile-toggle-between-implementation-and-test, projectile-find-related-file

| :other
| any other files if the given file has them.
| projectile-find-other-file, projectile-find-related-file

| :foo
| any key other than above
| projectile-find-related-file
|===

For each value, following type can be used:

|===
| Type | Meaning

| string / a list of strings
| Relative paths from the project root. The paths which actually exist on the file system will be matched.

| a function
| A predicate which accepts a relative path as the input and return t if it matches.

| nil
| No match exists.
|===

Notes:

. For a big project consisting of many source files, returning strings instead
of a function can be fast as it does not iterate over each source file.
. There is a difference in behaviour between no key and `nil` value for the
key. Only when the key does not exist, other project options such as
`:test_prefix` or `projectile-other-file-alist` mechanism is tried.
. If the `:test-dir` option is set to a function, this will take precedence over
any value for `:related-files-fn` set when `projectile-toggle-between-implementation-and-test` is called.

==== Example - Same source file name for test and impl

[source,elisp]
----
(defun my/related-files (path)
  (if (string-match (rx (group (or "src" "test")) (group "/" (1+ anything) ".cpp")) path)
      (let ((dir (match-string 1 path))
            (file-name (match-string 2 path)))
        (if (equal dir "test")
            (list :impl (concat "src" file-name))
          (list :test (concat "test" file-name)
                :other (concat "src" file-name ".def"))))))

(projectile-register-project-type
   ;; ...
   :related-files-fn #'my/related-files)
----

With the above example, src/test directory can contain the same name file for test and its implementation file.
For example, "src/foo/abc.cpp" will match to "test/foo/abc.cpp" as test file and "src/foo/abc.cpp.def" as other file.

==== Example - Different test prefix per extension

A custom function for the project using multiple programming languages with different test prefixes.

[source,elisp]
----
(defun my/related-files(file)
  (let ((ext-to-test-prefix '(("cpp" . "Test")
                              ("py" . "test_"))))
    (if-let ((ext (file-name-extension file))
             (test-prefix (assoc-default ext ext-to-test-prefix))
             (file-name (file-name-nondirectory file)))
        (if (string-prefix-p test-prefix file-name)
            (let ((suffix (concat "/" (substring file-name (length test-prefix)))))
              (list :impl (lambda (other-file)
                            (string-suffix-p suffix other-file))))
          (let ((suffix (concat "/" test-prefix file-name)))
            (list :test (lambda (other-file)
                          (string-suffix-p suffix other-file))))))))
----

`projectile-find-related-file` command is also available to find and choose
related files of any kinds. For example, the custom function can specify the
related documents with ':doc' key. Note that `projectile-find-related-file` only
relies on `:related-files-fn` for now.

=== Related file custom function helper

`:related-files-fn` can accept a list of custom functions to combine the result
of each custom function. This allows users to write several custom functions
and apply them differently to projects.

Projectile includes a couple of helpers to generate commonly used custom functions.

|===
| Helper name and params | Purpose

| groups KIND GROUPS
| Relates files in each group as the specified kind.

| extensions KIND EXTENSIONS
| Relates files with extensions as the specified kind.

| test-with-prefix EXTENSION PREFIX
| Relates files with prefix and extension as :test and :impl.

| test-with-suffix EXTENSION SUFFIX
| Relates files with suffix and extension as :test and :impl.
|===

Each helper means `projectile-related-files-fn-helper-name` function.

==== Example usage of projectile-related-files-fn-helpers

[source,elisp]
----
(setq my/related-files
      (list
       (projectile-related-files-fn-extensions :other '("cpp" "h" "hpp"))
       (projectile-related-files-fn-test-with-prefix "cpp" "Test")
       (projectile-related-files-fn-test-with-suffix "el" "_test")
       (projectile-related-files-fn-groups
        :doc
        '(("doc/common.txt"
           "src/foo.h"
           "src/bar.h")))))

(projectile-register-project-type
   ;; ...
   :related-files-fn my/related-files)
----

=== Editing Existing Project Types

You can also edit specific options of already existing project types:

[source,elisp]
----
(projectile-update-project-type
 'sbt
 :related-files-fn
 (list
  (projectile-related-files-fn-test-with-suffix "scala" "Spec")
  (projectile-related-files-fn-test-with-suffix "scala" "Test"))
 :test-prefix nil
 :precedence 'high)
----

This will change the value of the `related-files-fn` option, remove the `test-prefix` option and `:precedence 'high` sets the sbt project type to be chosen in preference to other potentially clashing project types (a value `'low` would do the opposite).

=== `:test-dir`/`:src-dir` vs `:related-files-fn`

Whilst setting the `:test-dir` and `:src-dir` to strings is sufficient for most
purposes, using functions can give more flexibility.  As an example consider
(also using `f.el`):

[source,elisp]
----
(defun my-get-python-test-file (impl-file-path)
  "Return the corresponding test file directory for IMPL-FILE-PATH"
  (let* ((rel-path (f-relative impl-file-path (projectile-project-root)))
         (src-dir (car (f-split rel-path))))
    (cond ((f-exists-p (f-join (projectile-project-root) "test"))
           (projectile-complementary-dir impl-file-path src-dir "test"))
          ((f-exists-p (f-join (projectile-project-root) "tests"))
           (projectile-complementary-dir impl-file-path src-dir "tests"))
          (t (error "Could not locate a test file for %s!" impl-file-path)))))

(defun my-get-python-impl-file (test-file-path)
  "Return the corresponding impl file directory for TEST-FILE-PATH"
  (if-let* ((root (projectile-project-root))
            (rel-path (f-relative test-file-path root))
            (src-dir-guesses `(,(f-base root) ,(downcase (f-base root)) "src"))
            (src-dir (cl-find-if (lambda (d) (f-exists-p (f-join root d)))
                                 src-dir-guesses)))
      (projectile-complementary-dir test-file-path "tests?" src-dir)
    (error "Could not locate a impl file for %s!" test-file-path)))

(projectile-update-project-type
 'python-pkg
 :src-dir #'my-get-python-impl-dir
 :test-dir #'my-get-python-test-dir)
----

This attempts to recognise projects using both `test` and `tests` as top level
directories for test files. An alternative using the `related-files-fn` option
could be:

[source,elisp]
----
(projectile-update-project-type
 'python-pkg
 :related-files-fn
 (list
  (projectile-related-files-fn-test-with-suffix "py" "_test")
  (projectile-related-files-fn-test-with-prefix "py" "test_")))
----

In fact this is a lot more flexible in terms of finding test files in different
locations, but will not create test files for you.

== Customizing Project Detection

Project detection is pretty simple - Projectile just runs a list of
project detection functions
(`projectile-project-root-functions`) until one of them returns
a project directory.

This list of functions is customizable, and while Projectile has some
defaults for it, you can tweak it however you see fit.

Let's take a closer look at `projectile-project-root-functions`:

[source,elisp]
----
(defcustom projectile-project-root-functions
  '(projectile-root-local
    projectile-root-bottom-up
    projectile-root-top-down
    projectile-root-top-down-recurring)
  "A list of functions for finding project roots."
  :group 'projectile
  :type '(repeat function))
----

The important thing to note here is that the functions get invoked in their
order on the list, so the functions earlier in the list will have a higher
precedence with respect to project detection. Let's examine the defaults:

* `projectile-root-local` looks for project path set via the buffer-local variable `projectile-project-root`. Typically you'd set this variable via `.dir-locals.el` and it will take precedence over everything else.

* `projectile-root-bottom-up` will start looking for a project marker file/folder(e.g. `.projectile`, `.hg`, `.git`) from the current folder (a.k.a. `default-directory` in Emacs lingo) up the directory tree. It will return the first match it discovers. The assumption is pretty simple - the root marker appear only once, at the root folder of a project. If a root marker appear in several nested folders (e.g. you've got nested git projects), the bottom-most (closest to the current dir) match has precedence. You can customize the root markers recognized by this function via `projectile-project-root-files-bottom-up`

* `projectile-root-top-down` is similar, but it will return the top-most (farthest from the current directory) match. It's configurable via `projectile-project-root-files` and all project manifest markers like `pom.xml`, `Gemfile`, `project.clj`, etc go there.

* `projectile-root-top-down-recurring` will look for project markers that can appear at every level of a project (e.g. `Makefile` or `.svn`) and will return the top-most match for those.

The default ordering should work well for most people, but depending on the structure of your project you might want to tweak it.

Re-ordering those functions will alter the project detection, but you can also replace the list. Here's how you can delegate the project detection to Emacs's built-in function `vc-root-dir`:

[source,elisp]
----
;; we need this wrapper to match Projectile's API
(defun projectile-vc-root-dir (dir)
  "Retrieve the root directory of the project at DIR using `vc-root-dir'."
  (let ((default-directory dir))
    (vc-root-dir)))

(setq projectile-project-root-functions '(projectile-vc-root-dir))
----

Similarly, you can leverage the built-in `project.el` like this:

[source,elisp]
----
;; we need this wrapper to match Projectile's API
(defun projectile-project-current (dir)
  "Retrieve the root directory of the project at DIR using `project-current'."
  (cdr (project-current nil dir)))

(setq projectile-project-root-functions '(projectile-project-current))
----

== Ignoring files

WARNING: The contents of `.projectile` are ignored when using the
 `alien` project indexing method.

If you'd like to instruct Projectile to ignore certain files in a
project, when indexing it you can do so in the `.projectile` file by
adding each path to ignore, where the paths all are relative to the
root directory and start with a slash. Everything ignored should be
preceded with a `-` sign. Alternatively, not having any prefix at all
also means to ignore the directory or file pattern that follows.
Here's an example for a typical Rails application:

----
-/log
-/tmp
-/vendor
-/public/uploads
----

This would ignore the folders only at the root of the project.
Projectile also supports relative pathname ignores:

----
-tmp
-*.rb
-*.yml
-models
----

You can also ignore everything except certain subdirectories. This is
useful when selecting the directories to keep is easier than selecting
the directories to ignore, although you can do both. To select
directories to keep, that means everything else will be ignored.

Example:

----
+/src/foo
+/tests/foo
----

Keep in mind that you can only include subdirectories, not file
patterns.

If both directories to keep and ignore are specified, the directories
to keep first apply, restricting what files are considered. The paths
and patterns to ignore are then applied to that set.

Finally, you can override ignored files. This is especially useful
when some files ignored by your VCS should be considered as part of
your project by projectile:

----
!/src/foo
!*.yml
----

When a path is overridden, its contents are still subject to ignore
patterns. To override those files as well, specify their full path
with a bang prefix.

If you would like to include comment lines in your .projectile file,
you can customize the variable `projectile-dirconfig-comment-prefix`.
Assigning it a non-nil character value, e.g. `#`, will cause lines in
the .projectile file starting with that character to be treated as
comments instead of patterns.

=== File-local project root definitions

If you want to override the projectile project root for a specific
file, you can set the file-local variable `projectile-project-root`. This
can be useful if you have files within one project that are related to
a different project (for instance, Org files in one git repo that
correspond to other projects).

== Storing project settings

From project to project, some things may differ even in the same
language - coding styles, auto-completion sources, etc.  If you need
to set some variables according to the selected project, you can use a
standard Emacs feature called
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html[Per-directory Local Variables].
To use it you must create a file named `.dir-locals.el` (as specified
by the constant `dir-locals-file`) inside the project directory.  This
file should contain something like this:

[source,elisp]
----
((nil . ((secret-ftp-password . "secret")
         (compile-command . "make target-x")
         (eval . (progn
                   (defun my-project-specific-function ()
                     ;; ...
                     )))))
 (c-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD"))))
----

The top-level alist member referenced with the key `nil` applies to
the entire project.  A key with the name `eval` will evaluate its
corresponding value.  In the example above, this is used to create a
function.  It could also be used to e.g. add such a function to a key
map.

TIP: You can also quickly visit or create the `dir-locals-file` with
kbd:[s-p E] (kbd:[M-x] `projectile-edit-dir-locals` kbd:[RET]).

Here are a few examples of how to use this feature with Projectile.

== Configuring Projectile's Behavior

Projectile exposes many variables (via `defcustom`) which allow users
to customize its behavior.  Directory variables can be used to set
these customizations on a per-project basis.

You could enable caching for a project in this way:

[source,elisp]
----
((nil . ((projectile-enable-caching . t))))
----

If one of your projects had a file that you wanted Projectile to
ignore, you would customize Projectile by:

[source,elisp]
----
((nil . ((projectile-globally-ignored-files . ("MyBinaryFile")))))
----

If you wanted to wrap the git command that Projectile uses to list
the files in you repository, you could do:

[source,elisp]
----
((nil . ((projectile-git-command . "/path/to/other/git ls-files -zco --exclude-standard"))))
----

If you want to use a different project name than how Projectile named
your project, you could customize it with the following:

[source,elisp]
----
((nil . ((projectile-project-name . "your-project-name-here"))))
----

By default, compilation buffers are not writable, which allows you to
e.g.  press `g` to restart the last command. Setting
`projectile-<cmd>-use-comint-mode` (where `<cmd>` is `configure`,
`compile`, `test`, `install`, `package`, or `run`) to a non-nil value
allows you to make projectile compilation buffers interactive, letting
you e.g. test a command-line program with `projectile-run-project`.

[source,elisp]
----
(setq projectile-comint-mode t)
----

== Configure a Project's Lifecycle Commands and Other Attributes

There are a few variables that are intended to be customized via `.dir-locals.el`.

* for configuration - `projectile-project-configure-cmd`
* for compilation - `projectile-project-compilation-cmd`
* for testing - `projectile-project-test-cmd`
* for installation - `projectile-project-install-cmd`
* for packaging - `projectile-project-package-cmd`
* for running - `projectile-project-run-cmd`
* for configuring the test prefix - `projectile-project-test-prefix`
* for configuring the test suffix - `projectile-project-test-suffix`
* for configuring the related-files-fn property - `projectile-project-related-files-fn`
* for configuring the src-dir property - `projectile-project-src-dir`
* for configuring the test-dir property - `projectile-project-test-dir`

When these variables have their default value of `nil`, Projectile
runs the default command for the current project type.  You can
override this behavior by setting them to either a string to run an
external command or an Emacs Lisp function:

[source,elisp]
----
(setq projectile-test-cmd #'custom-test-function)
----

In addition caching of commands can be disabled by setting the variable
`projectile-project-enable-cmd-caching` is to `nil`. This is useful for
preset-based CMake projects.
