= Frequently Asked Questions

== Why did you name it Projectile?

I wanted a name that's not as boring as `project.el` and implies that your
interaction with projects is going to speed up significantly. :-)

NOTE: Funny enough, a few years after Projectile was created, another similar
project called `project.el` was born. Despite its boring name it's a great
project and happens to be part of Emacs.

== How does Projectile compare to the built-in `project.el`?

`project.el` was introduced in Emacs 25.1, released in 2016, and a lot of people
have been asking since how do the two packages compare.

Internally they have a lot of differences (e.g. different approach to project discovery and indexing), but from the user standpoint they are probably quite similar
these days (circa 2021). Historically, Projectile had a lot more features, but many
of them found their way into `project.el` over the years. If all you need is
a way to quickly jump between project files or search/replace inside a project, you can't go wrong with both.

For me Projectile's biggest advantage will always be that it's more community-friendly
(e.g. the development happens on GitHub), and it's not restricted by the FSF
contributor agreement, which means that everyone can easily contribute to the project. Of course, this comes with the downside that you have to install Projectile
yourselves.

One under-appreciated advantage of Projectile is that it has way more documentation.
Okay, that's only an advantage if you're one of those rare people who enjoy reading it.

== Does Projectile provide any integration with `project.el`?

Starting with Projectile 2.7, Projectile will plug automatically its
project discovery functions in `project.el`. You can find more
information on the subject in the xref:usage.adoc["Usage"] section of
the documentation.

== Does Projectile work with TRAMP?

Yeah, it does. I don't use TRAMP myself, however, so I never paid that
much attention to the TRAMP support. It's mostly community-maintained.

== Why doesn't Projectile have a default prefix for its keybinding?

Historically Projectile used to use `C-c p` as the prefix for all of its commands.
I opted for the `C-c p` prefix fully aware that this violates https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html[a very
established Emacs
convention],
mostly because it felt practical and because pressing `C-c C-p` is not
super convenient for many people.

Eventually this was changed in Projectile 2.0. That's why currently Projectile
requires users to select a prefix key for its commands explicitly.

== What dependencies does Projectile have?

Projectile will work without any external dependencies out of the box.
However, if you have various tools installed, they will be
automatically used when appropriate to improve performance.

Inside version control repositories, VC tools are used when installed
to list files more efficiently. The supported tools include git, hg,
fossil, bzr, darcs, pijul, svn, sapling and jujutsu.

Outside version control repositories, file search tools are used when
installed for a faster search than pure Elisp. The supported tools
include https://github.com/sharkdp/fd[fd] and GNU/BSD find.

By default, if fd is installed, it is also used inside Git
repositories as an alternative to `git ls-files`, because `git
ls-files` has the limitation that it also lists deleted files until
the deletions are staged, which can be confusing. You can eliminate
the use of fd in this circumstance by setting `projectile-git-use-fd`
to nil.

== Do you need some help cleanup up all those tickets that have piled up?

Certainly! In our https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues/[issue
tracker] we've got
plenty of tickets marked with `Help Wanted` or `Good First Issue` that
you can take a stab at, if you'd like to help out!
