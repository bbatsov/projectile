;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides easy project management and navigation.  The
;; concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing
;; special file.  Currently git, mercurial and bazaar repos are
;; considered projects by default.  If you want to mark a folder
;; manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in
;; it.  See the README for more details.
