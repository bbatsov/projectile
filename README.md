## Synopsis

**Projectile** is a project interaction library for Emacs. Its goal is to
provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without
introducing external dependencies(when feasible). For instance -
finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure
Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU `find`(but for performance sake an
indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).

Projectile tries to be practical - portability is great, but if some
external tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools
are available, Projectile will leverage them.

This library provides easy project management and navigation. The
concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing
special file. Currently `git`, `mercurial`, `darcs` and `bazaar` repos
are considered projects by default. So are `lein`, `maven`, `sbt`,
`rebar` and `bundler` projects. If you want to mark a folder manually
as a project just create an empty `.projectile` file in it. Some of
projectile's features:

* jump to a file in project
* jump to a directory in project
* jump to a project buffer
* jump to a test in project
* toggle between code and its test
* jump to recently visited files in the project
* switch between projects you have worked on
* kill all project buffers
* replace in project
* multi-occur in project buffers
* grep in project
* regenerate project etags
* visit project in dired
* run make in a project with a single key chord

Here's a glimpse of Projectile in action:

## Installation

The recommended way to install Projectile is via MELPA or Marmalade.

### Manual

Just drop `projectile.el`,
[dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) and
[s.el](https://github.com/magnars/s.el) somewhere in your
`load-path`. I favour the folder `~/.emacs.d/vendor`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/vendor")
(require 'projectile)
```

### Marmalade

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of `package.el`
you can install Projectile from the
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) repository.

### MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of `package.el`
you can install Projectile from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net) repository. The version of
Projectile there will always be up-to-date, but it might be unstable
(albeit rarely).

### Emacs Prelude

Projectile is naturally part of the
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). If you're a Prelude
user - projectile is already properly configured and ready for
action.

## Usage

### Basic setup

You can enable projectile globally like this:

```lisp
(projectile-global-mode)
```

To enable projectile only in select modes:

```lisp
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'projectile-on)
```

#### Indexing method

Projectile had two modes of operation - one is portable and is
implemented in Emacs Lisp(therefore it's native to Emacs) and the
other relies on external commands like `find`, `git`, etc to obtain
the list of files in a project.

Since the native indexing mode is much slower, but default the second
method is used on all operating systems except Windows. To force the use of native indexing:

```lisp
(setq projectile-use-native-indexing t)
```

It's important to note that at the moment the `.projectile` is
consulted, while the project is getting indexed, only in the native
mode. This is intentional, since applying any filtering on the results
generated by external commands would impact performance greatly and
would that way eliminate its advantage - that's is so fast one
normally doesn't have to use caching with it.

#### Caching

Since indexing a big project is not exactly quick (especially in Emacs
Lisp), projectile support caching of the project's files. The caching
is enabled by default whenever native indexing is enabled.

To enable caching unconditionally use this snippet of code:

```lisp
(setq projectile-enable-caching t)
```

At this point you can try out a projectile command such as <kbd>C-c p f</kbd> (<kbd>M-x projectile-find-file RET</kbd>).

Running <kbd>C-u C-c p f</kbd> will invalidate the cache prior to
prompting you for a file to jump to.

Pressing <kbd>C-c p z</kbd> will add the currently visited file to the
cache for current project. Generally files created outside Emacs will
be added to the cache automatically the first time you open them.

#### Using Projectile everywhere

If you want Projectile to be usable in every directory (even without the presence of project file):

```lisp
(setq projectile-require-project-root nil)
```

This might not be a great idea if you start projectile in your home folder for instance :-)

#### Completion Options

If you don't like ido you can use regular completion as well:

```lisp
(setq projectile-completion-system 'default)
```

You might want to combine default completion with `icomplete-mode` for optimum results.

You can also set `projectile-completion-system` to a function:

```lisp
(setq projectile-completion-system 'my-custom-completion-fn)
(setq projectile-completion-system
      (lambda (prompt choices)
        ;; ...
        ))
```

An example of a custom completion function is
[this one](https://gist.github.com/rejeep/5933343), which only show
the file name (not including path) and if the file selected is not
unique, another completion with names relative to project root
appears.

### Interactive Commands

Here's a list of the interactive Emacs Lisp functions, provided by projectile:

Keybinding         | Description
-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
<kbd>C-c p f</kbd> | Display a list of all files in the project. With a prefix argument it will clear the cache first.
<kbd>C-c p d</kbd> | Display a list of all directories in the project. With a prefix argument it will clear the cache first.
<kbd>C-c p T</kbd> | Display a list of all test files(specs, features, etc) in the project.
<kbd>C-c p g</kbd> | Run grep on the files in the project.
<kbd>C-c p b</kbd> | Display a list of all project buffers currently open.
<kbd>C-c p o</kbd> | Runs `multi-occur` on all project buffers currently open.
<kbd>C-c p r</kbd> | Runs interactive query-replace on all files in the projects.
<kbd>C-c p i</kbd> | Invalidates the project cache (if existing).
<kbd>C-c p R</kbd> | Regenerates the projects `TAGS` file.
<kbd>C-c p k</kbd> | Kills all project buffers.
<kbd>C-c p D</kbd> | Opens the root of the project in `dired`.
<kbd>C-c p e</kbd> | Shows a list of recently visited project files.
<kbd>C-c p a</kbd> | Runs `ack` on the project. Requires the presence of `ack-and-a-half`.
<kbd>C-c p c</kbd> | Runs a standard compilation command for your type of project.
<kbd>C-c p p</kbd> | Runs a standard test command for your type of project.
<kbd>C-c p z</kbd> | Adds the currently visited to the cache.
<kbd>C-c p s</kbd> | Display a list of known projects you can switch to.

If you ever forget any of Projectile's keybindings just do a:

<kbd>C-c p C-h</kbd>

### Ignoring files

If you'd like to instruct Projectile to ignore certain files in a
project, when indexing it you can do so in the `.projectile` file by
adding each path to ignore, where the paths all are relative to the
root directory and start with a slash. Everything ignored should be
preceded with a - sign. Alternatively, not having any prefix at all
also means to ignore the directory or file pattern that follows.
Here's an example for a typical Rails application:

```
-/log
-/tmp
-/vendor
-/public/uploads
```

This would ignore the folders only at the root of the project.
Projectile also supports relative pathname ignores:

```
-tmp
-*.rb
-*.yml
-models
```

You can also ignore everything except certain subdirectories. This is
useful when selecting the directories to keep is easier than selecting
the directories to ignore, although you can do both. To select
directories to keep, that means everything else will be ignored.
Example:

```
+/src/foo
+/tests/foo
```

Keep in mind that you can only include subdirectories, not file
patterns.

If both directories to keep and ignore are specified, the directories
to keep first apply, restricting what files are considered. The paths
and patterns to ignore are then applied to that set.


### Helm Integration

Projectile can be integrated with
[Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) via
`helm-c-source-projectile` source (available in `helm-projectile.el`). There is also an example function
for calling Helm with the Projectile file source. You can call it like
this:

```
M-x helm-projectile
```

or even better - bind it to a keybinding like this:

```lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c h") 'helm-projectile)
```

Obviously you need to have Helm installed for this to work :-)

## Caveats

* Traversing the project directory programmatically (instead of using
  something like GNU find) is not very fast. On the other hand - it's
  portable. Unlike
  [find-file-in-project](https://github.com/bbatsov/find-file-in-project),
  projectile's jump-to-file will work on any OS.
* Some operations like search(grep) depend (presently) on external
  utilities such as `find`.
