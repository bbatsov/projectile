## Synopsis

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/bbatsov/projectile](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/bbatsov/projectile?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

**Projectile** is a project interaction library for Emacs. Its goal is to
provide a nice set of features operating on a project level without
introducing external dependencies(when feasible). For instance -
finding project files has a portable implementation written in pure
Emacs Lisp without the use of GNU `find` (but for performance sake an
indexing mechanism backed by external commands exists as well).

Projectile tries to be practical - portability is great, but if some
external tools could speed up some task substantially and the tools
are available, Projectile will leverage them.

This library provides easy project management and navigation. The
concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing
special file. Currently `git`, `mercurial`, `darcs` and `bazaar` repos
are considered projects by default. So are `lein`, `maven`, `sbt`,
`scons`, `rebar` and `bundler` projects. If you want to mark a folder
manually as a project just create an empty `.projectile` file in
it. Some of Projectile's features:

* jump to a file in project
* jump to files at point in project
* jump to a directory in project
* jump to a file in a directory
* jump to a project buffer
* jump to a test in project
* toggle between files with same names but different extensions (e.g. `.h` <-> `.c/.cpp`, `Gemfile` <-> `Gemfile.lock`)
* toggle between code and its test
* jump to recently visited files in the project
* switch between projects you have worked on
* kill all project buffers
* replace in project
* multi-occur in project buffers
* grep in project
* regenerate project etags or gtags (requires [ggtags](https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags)).
* visit project in dired
* run make in a project with a single key chord

Here's a glimpse of Projectile in action:

## Installation

The recommended way to install Projectile is via `package.el`.

### package.el

#### MELPA

You can install a snapshot version of Projectile from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
Projectile there will always be up-to-date, but it might be unstable
(albeit rarely).

#### MELPA Stable

You can install the last stable version of Projectile from the
[MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org) repository.

### el-get

Projectile is also available for installation from the [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) package manager.

### Emacs Prelude

Projectile is naturally part of the
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). If you're a Prelude
user - Projectile is already properly configured and ready for
action.

## Usage

### Basic setup

You can enable Projectile globally like this:

```el
(projectile-global-mode)
```

To enable Projectile only in select modes:

```el
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'projectile-mode)
```

If you're going to use the default `ido` completion it's
**extremely highly** recommended that you install the optional
[flx-ido package](https://github.com/lewang/flx), which provides a much
more powerful alternative to `ido`'s built-in `flex` matching.

#### Indexing method

Projectile has two modes of operation - one is portable and is
implemented in Emacs Lisp(therefore it's native to Emacs and is known
as the `native indexing method`) and the other relies on external
commands like `find`, `git`, etc to obtain the list of files in a
project.

Since the native indexing mode is much slower, by default the second
method is used on all operating systems except Windows. To force the
use of native indexing in operating systems other than Windows:

```el
(setq projectile-indexing-method 'native)
```

To force the use of external indexing in Windows:

```el
(setq projectile-indexing-method 'alien)
```

This can speed up Projectile in Windows significantly. The disadvantage of this
method is that it's not well supported on Windows systems. If there's problem,
you can always use native indexing mode.

#### Caching

#### Project files

Since indexing a big project is not exactly quick (especially in Emacs
Lisp), Projectile supports caching of the project's files. The caching
is enabled by default whenever native indexing is enabled.

To enable caching unconditionally use this snippet of code:

```el
(setq projectile-enable-caching t)
```

At this point you can try out a Projectile command such as <kbd>C-c p f</kbd> (<kbd>M-x projectile-find-file RET</kbd>).

Running <kbd>C-u C-c p f</kbd> will invalidate the cache prior to
prompting you for a file to jump to.

Pressing <kbd>C-c p z</kbd> will add the currently visited file to the
cache for current project. Generally files created outside Emacs will
be added to the cache automatically the first time you open them.

The project cache is persistent and will be preserved during Emacs restarts.

You can purge an individual file from the cache with `M-x projectile-purge-file-from-cache` or an
entire directory with `M-x projectile-purge-dir-from-cache`.

##### File exists cache

Projectile does many file existence checks since that is how it identifies an
project root. Normally this is fine, however in some situations the file system
speed is much slower than usual and can make emacs "freeze" for extended
periods of time when opening files and browsing directories.

The most common example would be interfacing with remote systems using
TRAMP/ssh. By default all remote file existence checks are cached

To disable remote file exists cache that use this snippet of code:

```el
(setq projectile-file-exists-remote-cache-expire nil)
```

To change the remote file exists cache expire to 10 minutes use this snippet
of code:

```el
(setq projectile-file-exists-remote-cache-expire (* 10 60))
```

You can also enable the cache for local file systems, that is normally not
needed but possible:

```el
(setq projectile-file-exists-local-cache-expire (* 5 60))
```

#### Using Projectile everywhere

If you want Projectile to be usable in every directory (even without the presence of project file):

```el
(setq projectile-require-project-root nil)
```

This might not be a great idea if you start Projectile in your home folder for instance. :-)

#### Switching projects

When running `projectile-switch-project` (<kbd>C-c p p</kbd>) Projectile invokes
the command specified in `projectile-switch-project-action` (by default it is
`projectile-find-file`).

Depending on your personal workflow and habits, you
may prefer to alter the value of `projectile-switch-project-action`:

###### `projectile-find-file`

This is the default.  With this setting, once you have selected your
project via Projectile's completion system (see below), you will
remain in the completion system to select a file to visit. `projectile-find-file`
is capable of retrieving files in all sub-projects under the project root,
such as Git submodules. Currently, only Git is supported. Support for other VCS
will be added in the future.

###### `projectile-find-file-in-known-projects`

Similar to `projectile-find-file` but lists all files in all known projects. Since
the total number of files could be huge, it is beneficial to enable caching for subsequent
usages.

###### `projectile-find-file-dwim`

If point is on a filepath, Projectile first tries to search for that
file in project:

- If it finds just a file, it switches to that file instantly.  This
works even if the filename is incomplete, but there's only a single file
in the current project that matches the filename at point. For example,
if there's only a single file named "projectile/projectile.el" but the
current filename is "projectile/proj" (incomplete), projectile-find-file
still switches to "projectile/projectile.el" immediately because this
is the only filename that matches.

- If it finds a list of files, the list is displayed for selecting. A
list of files is displayed when a filename appears more than one in the
project or the filename at point is a prefix of more than two files in a
project. For example, if `projectile-find-file' is executed on a
filepath like "projectile/", it lists the content of that directory.
If it is executed on a partial filename like "projectile/a", a list of
files with character 'a' in that directory is presented.

- If it finds nothing, display a list of all files in project for
  selecting.

###### `projectile-dired`

```el
(setq projectile-switch-project-action 'projectile-dired)
```

With this setting, once you have selected your project, the top-level
directory of the project is immediately opened for you in a dired
buffer.

###### `projectile-find-dir`

```el
(setq projectile-switch-project-action 'projectile-find-dir)
```

With this setting, once you have selected your project, you will
remain in Projectile's completion system to select a sub-directory of
your project, and then *that* sub-directory is opened for you in a
dired buffer.  If you use this setting, then you will probably also
want to set

```el
(setq projectile-find-dir-includes-top-level t)
```

in order to allow for the occasions where you want to select the
top-level directory.

#### Completion Options

##### Ido

By default Projectile uses `ido` as it completion system. `ido` is
extremely popular and it is built into Emacs.

As already noted above if you're going to use the `ido` completion it's
**extremely highly** recommended that you install the optional
[flx-ido package](https://github.com/lewang/flx), which provides a much
more powerful alternative to `ido`'s built-in `flex` matching.

##### Grizzl

Another completion option is [grizzl](https://github.com/d11wtq/grizzl):

```el
(setq projectile-completion-system 'grizzl)
```

![Projectile Screenshot](screenshots/projectile-grizzl.png)

`grizzl`'s advantage is that it provides good fuzzy completion
(compared to `ido`'s less than stellar built-in flex matching, but inferior to `ido-flx`).

##### Basic (Emacs's default)

If you don't like `ido` and `grizzl` you can use regular completion:

```el
(setq projectile-completion-system 'default)
```

You might want to combine default completion with `icomplete-mode` for optimum results.

##### Custom Completion Function

You can also set `projectile-completion-system` to a function:

```el
(setq projectile-completion-system 'my-custom-completion-fn)
(setq projectile-completion-system
      (lambda (prompt choices)
        ;; ...
        ))
```

An example of a custom completion function is
[this one](https://gist.github.com/rejeep/5933343), which only show
the file name (not including path) and if the file selected is not
unique, another completion with names relative to project root
appears.

##### Regenerate tags

To be able to regenerate a project's tags via `projectile-tags-command`, you
should install and add to the PATH
[Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) instead of a plain ctags, which
ships with Emacs distribution.

<kbd>C-c p e</kbd> | Shows a list of recently visited project files.
<kbd>C-c p s s</kbd> | Runs `ag` on the project. Requires the presence of `ag.el`.
<kbd>C-c p !</kbd> | Runs `shell-command` in the root directory of the project.
<kbd>C-c p &</kbd> | Runs `async-shell-command` in the root directory of the project.
<kbd>C-c p c</kbd> | Runs a standard compilation command for your type of project.
<kbd>C-c p P</kbd> | Runs a standard test command for your type of project.
<kbd>C-c p t</kbd> | Toggle between an implementation file and its test file.
<kbd>C-c p 4 t</kbd> | Jump to implementation or test file in other window.
<kbd>C-c p z</kbd> | Adds the currently visited file to the cache.
<kbd>C-c p p</kbd> | Display a list of known projects you can switch to.

<kbd>C-c p m</kbd> | Run the commander (an interface to run commands with a single key).
<kbd>C-c p ESC</kbd> | Switch to the most recently selected projectile buffer.

If you ever forget any of Projectile's keybindings just do a:

<kbd>C-c p C-h</kbd>

You can change the default keymap prefix `C-c p` like this:

```el
(setq projectile-keymap-prefix (kbd "C-c C-p"))
```

It is also possible to add additional commands to
`projectile-command-map` referenced by the prefix key in
`projectile-mode-map`. You can even add an alternative prefix for all
commands. Here's an example that adds `super-p` as the extra prefix:

```el
(define-key some-keymap (kbd "s-p") 'projectile-command-map)
```

For some common commands you might want to take a little shortcut and
leverage the fairly unused `Super` key (by default `Command` on Mac
keyboards and `Windows` on Win keyboards). Here's something you can
add to your Emacs config:

```el
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-d] 'projectile-find-dir)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-p] 'projectile-switch-project)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-f] 'projectile-find-file)
(define-key projectile-mode-map [?\s-g] 'projectile-grep)
```

Note that the `Super` keybindings are not usable in Windows. Emacs
Prelude already adds those extra keybindings.

### Ignoring files

If you'd like to instruct Projectile to ignore certain files in a
project, when indexing it you can do so in the `.projectile` file by
adding each path to ignore, where the paths all are relative to the
root directory and start with a slash. Everything ignored should be
preceded with a - sign. Alternatively, not having any prefix at all
also means to ignore the directory or file pattern that follows.
Here's an example for a typical Rails application:

```
-/log
-/tmp
-/vendor
-/public/uploads
```

This would ignore the folders only at the root of the project.
Projectile also supports relative pathname ignores:

```
-tmp
-*.rb
-*.yml
-models
```

You can also ignore everything except certain subdirectories. This is
useful when selecting the directories to keep is easier than selecting
the directories to ignore, although you can do both. To select
directories to keep, that means everything else will be ignored.

Example:

```
+/src/foo
+/tests/foo
```

Keep in mind that you can only include subdirectories, not file
patterns.

If both directories to keep and ignore are specified, the directories
to keep first apply, restricting what files are considered. The paths
and patterns to ignore are then applied to that set.

### Customizing project root files

You can set the values of `projectile-project-root-files`,
`projectile-project-root-files-top-down-recurring`,
`projectile-project-root-files-bottom-up` and
`projectile-project-root-files-functions` to customize how project roots are
identified.

To customize project root files settings:

```
M-x customize-group RET projectile RET
```

### Storing project settings

From project to project some things may differ even in same language -
different coding styles, separate auto-completion sources, etc.  If
you need to set some variables according to selected project, you can
use standard Emacs feature called
[Per-Directory Local Variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html). To
use it you must create file named `.dir-locals.el` inside project
directory. This file must contain something like this:

```
((nil . ((secret-ftp-password . "secret")
         (compile-command . "make target-x")
         (eval . (progn
                   (defun my-project-specific-function ()
                     ;; ...
                     ))))
 (c-mode . (c-file-style . "BSD")))
```

The top-level alist member referenced with the key `nil` applies to the
entire project. A key with the name `eval` will evaluate its
arguments. In the example above, this is used to create a function. It
could also be used to e.g. add such a function to a key map.

Here are a few examples of how to use this feature with Projectile.

#### Configuring Projectile's Behavior

Projectile offers many customizable variables (via `defcustom`) that
allows us to customize its behavior. Because of how `dir-locals.el`
works, it can be used to set these customizations on a per-project basis.

You could enable caching for a project in this way:

```
((nil . ((projectile-enable-caching . t))))
```

If one of your projects had a file that you wanted Projectile to
ignore, you would customize Projectile by:

```
((nil . ((projectile-globally-ignored-files . '("MyBinaryFile")))))
```

If you wanted to wrap the git command that Projectile uses to find list
the files in you repository, you could do:

```
((nil . ((projectile-git-command . "/path/to/other/git ls-files -zco --exclude-standard"))))
```

#### Configure Project's Compilation Command

Overriding pieces of Projectile might require some hacking on your
part -- reading the source, advising functions, etc.

For example, by reading Projectile's source, you could discover that
a project's compilation command can be specified with this code:

```
((nil . ((eval . (progn
                   ;; require projectile; the following code will fail
                   ;; without it.
                   (require 'projectile)
                   ;; provide a fake "recent" compilation cmd
                   ;; which will be returned by the function
                   ;; `projectile-compilation-command`
                   (puthash (projectile-project-root)
                            "./command-to-compile-your-project.sh"
                            projectile-compilation-cmd-map))))))
```

#### Configure Project's Test Command

Altering the test command works in the same way as altering the
compilation command. Comments are left out in this example for
brevity and clarity:

```
((nil . ((eval . (progn
                   (require 'projectile)
                   (puthash (projectile-project-root)
                            "./test-project.sh"
                            projectile-test-cmd-map))))))
```

### Helm Integration

Projectile can be integrated with [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) via
`helm-source-projectile-projects`, `helm-source-projectile-files-list`,
`helm-source-projectile-buffers-list` and `helm-source-projectile-recentf-list`
sources (available in `helm-projectile.el`). There is also an example function
for calling Helm with the Projectile file source. You can call it like this:

```
M-x helm-projectile
```

or even better - invoke the key binding <kbd>C-c p h</kbd>.

For those who prefer helm to ido, the command `helm-projectile-switch-project`
can be used to replace `projectile-switch-project` to switch project. Please
note that this is different from simply setting `projectile-completion-system`
to `helm`, which just enables projectile to use the Helm completion to complete
a project name. The benefit of using `helm-projectile-switch-project` is that on
any selected project we can fire many actions, not limited to just the "switch
to project" action, as in the case of using helm completion by setting
`projectile-completion-system` to `helm`. Currently, there are five actions:
"Switch to project", "Open Dired in project's directory", "Open project root in
vc-dir or magit", "Switch to Eshell" and "Grep project files". We will add more
and more actions in the future.

`helm-projectile` is capable of opening multiple files by marking the files with
<kbd>C-SPC</kbd> or mark all files with <kdb>M-a</kbd>. Then, press <kdb>RET</kbd>,
all the selected files will be opened.

Note that the helm grep is different from `projectile-grep` because the helm
grep is incremental. To use it, select your projects (select multiple projects
by pressing C-SPC), press "C-s" (or "C-u C-s" for recursive grep), and type your
regexp. As you type the regexp in the mini buffer, the live grep results are
displayed incrementally.

`helm-projectile` also provides Helm versions of common Projectile commands. Currently,
these are the supported commands:

* `helm-projectile-switch-project`
* `helm-projectile-find-file`
* `helm-projectile-find-file-in-known-projects`
* `helm-projectile-find-file-dwim`
* `helm-projectile-find-dir`
* `helm-projectile-recentf`
* `helm-projectile-switch-to-buffer`
* `helm-projectile-grep` (can be used for both grep or ack)
* `helm-projectile-ag`
* Replace Helm equivalent commands in `projectile-commander`
* A virtual directory manager that is unique to Helm Projectile

Why should you use these commands compared with the normal Projectile commands, even
if the normal commands use `helm` as `projectile-completion-system`? The answer is,
Helm specific commands give more useful features. For example, `helm-projectile-switch-project`
allows opening a project in Dired, Magit or Eshell. `helm-projectile-find-file` reuses actions in
`helm-find-files` (which is plenty) and able to open multiple files. Another reason is that in a large
source tree, helm-projectile could be slow because it has to open all available sources.

If you want to use these commands, you have to activate it to replace the normal Projectile
commands:

```lisp
;; (setq helm-projectile-fuzzy-match nil)
(require 'helm-projectile)
(helm-projectile-on)
```

If you already activate helm-projectile key bindings and you don't like it, you can turn it off
and use the normal Projectile bindings with command `helm-projectile-off`. Similarly, if you want to
disable fuzzy matching in Helm Projectile (it is enabled by default), you must set `helm-projectile-fuzzy-match`
to nil before loading `helm-projectile`.

To fully learn Helm Projectile and see what it is capable of, you should refer to this guide:
[Exploring large projects with Projectile and Helm Projectile](http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html).

Obviously you need to have Helm installed for this to work :-)

### Work with Perspective Mode

[Perspective](https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el) is a minor mode
that provides the ability to manage different workspaces. If you need
to open many projects at the same time, perspective can help you keep
each project related buffers and windows setting separate from other
projects, similar to multiple spaces on MacOS, which allows you to
focus on the files of the current active project.

A picture says a thousand words. See below screenshot to get a concrete idea.

Only current project related files showing in minibuffer when I call
`ido-switch-buffer`, and an indicator in mode line tells me which
project that I'm in.

![Persp-Projectile Screenshot 1](screenshots/persp-projectile1.png)

When I switch to a different project, I get a clean 'perspective'.

![Persp-Projectile Screenshot 2](screenshots/persp-projectile2.png)

To integrate perspective with projectile, first of all, you need to
install perspective. You can install it by:

```
M-x package-install
```

Then type `perspective` in the minibuffer, as below:

```
Install package: perspective
```

Secondly, make sure `persp-projectile.el` is in your Emacs load path. Then require it in your init file.

```el
(persp-mode)
(require 'persp-projectile)
```

You're ready to go! Try the interactive command
`projectile-persp-switch-project`, or you may also bind it to some
handy keybinding.

```el
(define-key projectile-mode-map (kbd "s-s") 'projectile-persp-switch-project)
```

### Idle Timer

Projectile can be configured to run the hook
`projectile-idle-timer-hook` every time Emacs is in a project and has
been idle for `projectile-idle-timer-seconds` seconds (default is 30
seconds).  To enable this feature, run:

```
M-x customize-group RET projectile RET
```

and set `projectile-enable-idle-timer` to non-nil.  By default,
`projectile-idle-timer-hook` runs `projectile-regenerate-tags`.  Add
additional functions to the hook using `add-hook`:

```el
(add-hook 'projectile-idle-timer-hook 'my-projectile-idle-timer-function)
```

### Mode line indicator

By default the minor mode indicator of Projectile appears in the form
" Projectile[ProjectName]". This is configurable via the custom variable
`projectile-mode-line`, which expects a sexp like
`'(:eval (format " Proj[%s]" (projectile-project-name)))`

## Caveats

* Traversing the project directory programmatically (instead of using
  something like GNU find) is not very fast. On the other hand - it's
  portable. Unlike
  [find-file-in-project](https://github.com/bbatsov/find-file-in-project),
  projectile's jump-to-file will work on any OS.
* Some operations like search(grep) depend (presently) on external
  utilities such as `find`.

[issue list](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open)
a list of unresolved issues. By the way - feel free to fix any of them
and sent me a pull request. :-)

## Contributors

Here's a [list](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/contributors) of all the people who have contributed to the
development of Projectile.

## Contribution

All contributions are welcome, as long as they don't break anything
:-) To make sure you didn't introduce any regressions it's a good idea
to run the tests first.

Install [cask](https://github.com/rejeep/cask.el) if you haven't
already, then:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/projectile
$ cask
```

Run all tests with:

```bash
$ make test
```

You can also support my work on Projectile and [all my other projects](https://github.com/bbatsov) via [gratipay](https://www.gratipay.com/bbatsov).

## Bugs & Improvements

Bug reports and suggestions for improvements are always
welcome. GitHub pull requests are even better! :-)

Together we can create the ultimate project management tool for Emacs.
